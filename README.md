# Slidorus

Slidorus is a sliding puzzle made of 9 blocks, each containing 9 pieces, arranged in a 9Ã—9 grid.

Every row and column can be shifted in either direction. When a piece moves off one side of the grid, it reappears on the opposite side. In other words, the pieces move on a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus).

The puzzle is similar to 9Ã—9 [Loopover](https://loopover.xyz/), but with a Rubik's Cube-inspired color scheme and indistinguishable pieces within each 3Ã—3 block. The puzzle is solved when each 3Ã—3 block is uniformly colored; the exact placement of the blocks does not matter.

An additional option lets you "bandage" pieces together. This makes the puzzle significantly more complex, especially when many pieces are bandaged. Furthermore, it is possible to make pieces fixed, so that they will not move anymore. This adds yet another level of complexity.

The app works on both desktop and mobile. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
