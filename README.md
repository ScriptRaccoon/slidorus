# Slidorus

_Slidorus_ is a sliding puzzle made up of 9 blocks, each containing 9 pieces, arranged in a Sudoku-like 9×9 grid.

Every row and column can be shifted in both directions. When a piece moves out of the puzzle on one side, it reappears on the opposite side. In other words, the pieces move on a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus).

The puzzle is similar to 9×9 [Loopover](https://loopover.xyz/), but with a different color scheme and indistinguishable pieces within each 3×3 block. The puzzle is considered solved when each 3×3 block is uniformly colored; the exact positions of the blocks do not matter.
