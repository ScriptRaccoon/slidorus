				<summary>About this puzzle</summary>
				<p>
					<i>Torus Slider</i> is a sliding puzzle consisting of 9 blocks of 9
					pieces, arranged like in a Sudoku. Each row and each column can be
					moved in both directions. When a piece is about to move out of the
					puzzle, it comes back at the opposite side. Hence, the pieces actually
					move on a torus.
				</p>

				<p>
					The puzzle is very similar to
					<a href="https://loopover.xyz/">Loopover</a> of size 9x9, but with a
					different color scheme and with indistuishable pieces within each 3x3
					block. Moreover, the puzzle is already solved when each 3x3 block is
					single-color, i.e., the positions of the blocks do not matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Usage:</b> Drag a row or column to move it. This works both on
					touch and desktop devices. On desktop devices, you can also hover over
					a piece and then move its row or column with the 4 arrow keys.
